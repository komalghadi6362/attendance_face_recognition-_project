Smart Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition 
Project Overview The Smart Attendance Management System automates the process of recording student attendance using face recognition technology. This system captures real-time video feeds through a webcam, detects student faces using OpenCV, and matches them with a pre-stored database of student images. When a match is found, the system logs attendance automatically, eliminating the need for manual tracking.

The project includes a web interface where teachers can manage student data, view attendance reports, and receive notifications in case of missed attendance. Built with Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and SQLite, the system aims to improve efficiency, accuracy, and user experience in educational institutions.

Key Features: Automated attendance tracking via face recognition Real-time face detection using OpenCV Seamless user interface for managing student details and attendance reports Built with Flask/Django (Backend) and HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Frontend) Database management with SQLite

Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Flask/Django, SQLite, HTML/CSS, JavaScript
